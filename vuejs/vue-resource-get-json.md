# Use vue-resource to get json from API's

[vue-resource](https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource) is a http cliente for Vue.js. You can use it to grab JSON data from apis on a very simple way.

The first instinct from a developer coming from jQuery world is to use the famous `$.get` function.

Using *vue-resource* you can do just the same, without using jQuery.
