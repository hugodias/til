# Relative numbers

If you open vim for the first time you'll notice that as a normal editor, the lines are ordered in a ascending way. You can switch this option by using :set relativenumber or `set relativenumber` in your vimrc file to turn an exceptional feature.

Using **relativenumbers** the numbers on the left side of vim will be relative to the vertical position of the cursor. But why this is good? You don't need to do math when moving around anymore. Just look where you want to go, type the number, the direction (J or K) and done.
